My teammates were also all PhDs in the physics department at Penn. The idea for our project was from the then reigning champ, and now teammate, Rob. In his own words: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The beginnings of this idea came from long road trips. When driving having good visibility is very important. When driving into the sun, the sun visor never seemed to be able to actually cover the sun. When driving at night, the headlights of oncoming cars made for a few moments of dangerous low visibility. Why isn't there a better solution for these things? We decided to see if we could make one, and discovered a wide range of applications for this technology, going far beyond simply blocking light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we set out to develop a proof of concept to solve this problem.\nHow? Well, in one dense sentence, We wanted to create a dynamic window heads up display (HUD) that could track real world objects, as well as the user simultaneously, and then have superimposed information on the display window on the objects of interest relative to the user.\nThe 'super-imposed information' in this proof-of-concept would simply be a black dot rendered by the HUD that would block the bright light from your eyes regardless of where your eyes, or where the light, is at any time.<br>\nA mock up we made for a presentation during competition can be seen below. </p>\n<div class=\"page-image\">\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 925px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 38.28740157480315%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABDUlEQVQoz31Sy07DMBDMZ4BE6n3EdqwEyqMHKsSlqsSJX+AP+P/jsLaTJkGFw2jt9e54xutGRHANzAxRhYTe9lr3GVdqyTGY6lkjYhvOB4y65hVhB/H9FGPJbUGFKO47+FB7mkuzRdVJXclZcSbqAhy1cD5U4hmmXGMCacLb54DD0WPXGuFMRhZv7tpCVKxMqlyyYn/AS/8KFyM0JCMzdL4+icHR4qwozImH4PF9fofvB4jdnG/XdA820mBvFMNYFc9WV9aLAM7OJstEhGQWvk4fUInFcmm06I9n6PMRPOwvuf8G2ayHcOvo1zQVOj4ZHiH9uP0Bq7jGdijCi4r8PvnM7WySbqrR5Qv9ofIHLhbiFBef6KoAAAAASUVORK5CYII=&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"First Hackathon: Pennapps XIV\" title=\"First Hackathon: Pennapps XIV\" src=\"/static/ed3a9bbbb37278f333db6f16bebd4a60/a9c1d/eyeHUDtrump.png\" srcset=\"/static/ed3a9bbbb37278f333db6f16bebd4a60/de152/eyeHUDtrump.png 231w,\n/static/ed3a9bbbb37278f333db6f16bebd4a60/2af9b/eyeHUDtrump.png 463w,\n/static/ed3a9bbbb37278f333db6f16bebd4a60/a9c1d/eyeHUDtrump.png 925w,\n/static/ed3a9bbbb37278f333db6f16bebd4a60/644a5/eyeHUDtrump.png 1016w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n</div><!-- /.page-image -->\n<figcaption class=\"fig-spacing\"><i>Cameras represented by the blue dots are placed on either side of a transparent LCD screen and pointed away from eachother. The fucia dot represents an object that can be rendered on the screen and would lie in the line of sight between the user and the object of interest.</i></figcaption>\n<p>So to do this we needed a transparent LCD screen to act as our \"windshield\" as in the car example given above.\nUnfortunately these types of displays  are not really readily available (or cheap) as they really only have appeared (as far as I know) as proof of concepts at CES and other such events. So instead we had to settle with a much lower budget option, your every day LCD computer display.\nThe idea was that the monitor, when broken down to it's bare glass, was transparent enough to do what we wanted.\nWell luckily we did happen to have a LCD monitor with a broken backlight in our office.\nSo there in started the tearing apart the many more layers of an LCD screen than I had thought existed.\nI won't go into the details, but at essentially every new layer of the monitor that we had to remove we were all convinced that the project was dead because we couldn't remove the next layer.\nYet, we persevered and ultimately were able to get the bare glass out of the monitor (and still have it be working!).</p>\n<div class=\"image-right\">\n  <span

end carnage after the monitor tear down</i></figcaption>\n</div><!-- /.page-image -->\nNow with our &apos;transparent&apos; monitor up and working, a laptop webcam to do the user tracking, and a separate webcam that we bought from a CVS that night to do the object tracking, we had essentially all the hardware we needed to try to get this hack working. \n<p>On the software side we stumbled upon the open-source facial recognition software \"OpenCV.\" We ultimately used OpenCV's haar cascade classifier in python to perform our facial recognition.\nOnce the facial recognition was done we needed to locate the users eyes in 'pixel space' for the user camera, and locate the light with the other camera in its own pixel space.\nWe then wrote an algorithm that was able to translate the two separate pixel spaces into real 3D space, calculate the line that connects the object and the user, finds the intersection of this line and the monitor, and then finally translate this position into pixel space on the monitor in order to render a dot in the correct position.\nIf you lost count that is three different pixel spaces we are working with.\nIn order to make everything work we had to develop a calibration procedure in order to find the right transforms between these different pixel spaces.\nThe procedure was as follows</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pseudo-randomly place the dot on the screen such that it sampled the screen thoroughly. </li>\n<li>For each dot placement have the dot obstruct the light source relative to the user (move head/source around s.t. this is the case).\nThe user and the source must maintain a set distance away from the LCD screen (i.e. in a  plane) during the calibration due to the single camera limitation of our proof of concept. </li>\n<li>For each iteration use the equation for a line in a plane to compute the transforms.</li>\n<li>Fit transforms to find best fit value.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"image-right\">\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"

procedure that we came up with to provide the right transforms between these pixel spaces that we were probably most proud of in the end. </p>\n<p>Another difficulty was getting accurate tracking on the bright light on the far side of the monitor.\nThe web cam we were using was cheap and we had almost no access to the settings like aperture and exposure which made it so the light would easily saturate the CCD in the camera.\nBecause the light was saturating and the camera was trying to adjust its own exposure, other lights in the room were also saturating the CCD and so even bright spots on the white walls were being tracked as well.\nWe eventually solved this problem by reusing the radial diffuser that was on the backlight of the monitor we took apart.\nThis made any bright spots on the walls diffused well under the threshold for tracking. Even after this we had a bit of trouble locating the exact center of the light as we were still getting a bit of glare from the light on the camera lens.\nWe were able to solve this problem by applying a Gaussian convolution to the raw video before trying any tracking. This allowed us to accurately locate the center of the light.</p>\n<h1>Putting it All Together</h1>\n<p>By some miracle we were able to get a pretty good proof-of-concept working.\nIt wasn't the most optimized (clunky python script that was also doing a lot of work rendering other metrics on the screen) but it worked!\nIn the video below you can see the magic happen. Note that the dot seems to be offset from covering the light but this is just because the camera is offset from my eyeballs.\nThere was a balancing act there where I needed to get my phone camera as close to my eyes as possible to best demonstrate the rig, and at same time needed my face not to be obstructed so that the facial recognition worked!  </p>\n<div style=\"position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5E8dueHWfjA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\n    style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"fig-spacing\"><i>The team demoing our hack for the interwebs. Screen grab is  of me (in blue) explaining our hack to some of the competition's student organizers</i></figcaption>\n<h1>The Competition</h1>\n<p>In the first round of competition we were separated into two heats, as there didn't exist a large enough indoor hall at the university for every team set up at a table at the same time.\nWe were in the first heat and had to be there bright and early at 9am. Immediately our first challenge became just transporting our delicate contraption through campus to the competition area.\nSo after maybe three hours of sleep we loaded up the device onto a roller cart thing that we stole (borrowed) from some maintenance crew and made our way over.\nAnd believe you me that stripped down monitor screen felt every crack in the sidewalk.\nNevertheless we overcame this trial and made it to the first round before start time.\nWe did not arrive unscathed however, as upon start up of our hack it became apparent that a single column of pixels on our screen were now dead. Not a huge loss but something to be mindful of.   </p>\n<div class=\"page-image\">\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;

Yay!\nThere is a recorded stream of the final that exists somewhere, and if I feel like it adds to this post I'll track it down and add it in.\nWith that we had a choice of prizes but all ended up deciding on the Oculus rift.\nThe fact that our tracking display worked at all we felt was a huge accomplishment.\nEvery stage of this project felt like a big victory.\nAfter a couple of mostly sleepless nights and constant battling with endless new problems it really was quite satisfying to come away with a cool hack and some swag.  </p>\n<div class=\"page-image\">\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 925px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.748046875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"First Hackathon: Pennapps XIV\" title=\"First Hackathon: Pennapps XIV\" src=\"/static/b32d03ba27156337d29b639b23889990/6084b/PennApps3rdPlVictors.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/b32d03ba27156337d29b639b23889990/3b1a6/PennApps3rdPlVictors.jpg 231w,\n/static/b32d03ba27156337d29b639b23889990/7d99a/PennApps3rdPlVictors.jpg 463w,\n/static/b32d03ba27156337d29b639b23889990/6084b/PennApps3rdPlVictors.jpg 925w,\n/static/b32d03ba27156337d29b639b23889990/afe07/PennApps3rdPlVictors.jpg 1388w,\n/static/b32d03ba27156337d29b639b23889990/081b8/PennApps3rdPlVictors.jpg 1850w,\n/static/b32d03ba27156337d29b639b23889990/2b40c/PennApps3rdPlVictors.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n  <div class=\"image-credit\">Image source: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/pennapps/photos/\" itemprop=\"citation\">PennApps facebook</a></div><!-- /.image-credit -->\n</div><!-- /.page-image -->\n<figcaption class=\"fig-spacing\"><i>3rd place victory shot!
