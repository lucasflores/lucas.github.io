# [Personal Website](http://lucasflores.github.io)

This is a repository for the on going construction of my personal/professional website

This project draws from many veins of inspiration. Code and design ideas have bee pilfered through out the interwebs to form something that can hopefully be used for years to come. I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and jquery on this adventure, yet still consider my understanding to be very patchy and young (same goes for my use and understanding of github in geberal). Any help or suggestions are welcome. 

I would like to thank the following people:
* Jaan Altosaar, for being the inspiration to start this whole thing [http://jaan.io](http://jaan.io)
* Petr Tichy, for letting the masses use you awesome parralax scrolling sites so we nubiles can play with this cool stuff too, and for taking time out of your day to answer my silly questions [http://ihatetomatoes.net](http://ihatetomatoes.net)
* Nick Salloum for your super cool responsive image captions  [http://callmenick.com/](http://callmenick.com/)
* And probably a bunch of other people who have been so kind to post all their great ideas and help on the interwebs.
