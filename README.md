# [Personal Website](http://lucasflores.github.io)

This is a repository for the on going construction of my personal/professional website

This project draws from many veins of inspiration. Code and design ideas have bee pilfered through out the interwebs to form something that can hopefully be used from years to come. I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and jquery on this adventure, yet still consider my understanding to be very patchy and young.
