\chapter[Theoretical Framework][Theoretical Framework]{Theoretical Framework} \label{ch:theory}

In this chapter the mathematical theoretical framework is presented in which the physical measurements and computational modeling will be interpreted in the subsequent chapters.
For elementary particle physics this framework is \gls{qft}, a relativistically consistent quantum mechanics who's fundamental mathematical objects are fields instead of particles.
Within the mathematical umbrella of QFT comes one of the most successful physical theories ever developed, the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics.
While the success of the SM is undisputed, in its current form it can give no explanation for several big questions in physics. 
This invariably leads to extensions to the SM, known as beyond the the standard model (BSM) physics, with one of the most important and attractive extensions known as Supersymmetry.

%Composed of \gls{qed}, a QFT that describes the  interaction, and \gls{qcd}, a QFT that describes the strong interaction, the SM
