\label{ch:electronid}

\section{Introduction}
The ATLAS detector was designed to identify electrons with high efficiency as electrons are important for many measurements, including measurements of the properties of the \Wboson\ and \Zboson\ bosons, the Higgs boson, and the top quark, as well as for many searches for supersymmetric and exotic particles that decay to final states with electrons.
I have contributed to performance studies and the development of improved algorithms used to identify electrons in the ATLAS ``$e/\gamma$'' (e-gamma) performance group.
Through out this chapter electrons and photons may be spoken about together as they are effectively indistinguishable from the point of view of the EM Cal, but the primary focus will be electrons.
